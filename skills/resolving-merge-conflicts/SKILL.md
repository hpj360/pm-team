# Resolving Merge Conflicts

Resolve merge conflicts by tracing back to the **intent** of each side's changes. Never "accept both" or "accept theirs/ours" blindly.

适配自 mattpocock/skills (保留 intent-tracing 方法论，适配为 Hermes)。

## Principle: Intent > text

A conflict marker shows two versions of text. The real question is: **what was each side trying to achieve?** Resolve the intent, not the text.

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
def get_user(id): return db.users.find(id)
=======
def get_user(id): return cache.get_or_set(f"user:{id}", lambda: db.users.find(id))
>>>>>>> feature/caching
```

Bad resolution: pick one text.
Good resolution: "HEAD wants basic lookup; feature/caching wants caching. Resolution: use cached version but verify cache invalidation strategy is in place."

## Process

### 1. Identify conflicted files
```bash
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
```

### 2. For each conflict, trace intent
For each conflicted hunk:
- **Our side (HEAD)**: `git log -p -1 HEAD -- <file>` — what commit introduced this change and why?
- **Their side (MERGE_HEAD)**: `git log -p -1 MERGE_HEAD -- <file>` — what commit and why?
- **PR context**: if the branch has a PR, read the PR description for intent

### 3. Classify the conflict

| Type | Resolution strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| **Independent additions** | Both changes are additive in different places → keep both |
| **Same purpose, different impl** | Both solve the same problem → pick the better one, cite why |
| **Conflicting purposes** | Changes serve different goals → reconcile or escalate to human |
| **One side stale** | One change was since superseded → keep the current one |
| **Formatting only** | Whitespace/imports → pick whichever, note it |

### 4. Resolve
Edit the file to reflect the **reconciled intent**. Add a comment if the resolution is non-obvious:

```python
# Resolved conflict: feature/caching adds cache layer (PR #42),
# HEAD's None-check is retained as cache.get_or_set handles None.
def get_user(id):
    return cache.get_or_set(
        f"user:{id}",
        lambda: db.users.find(id)
    )
```

### 5. Verify
```bash
git add <resolved-files>
# Run tests / type-check / lint to verify resolution doesn't break
ruff check <resolved-files>
mypy <resolved-files>
pytest tests/ -k <relevant>
```

### 6. Document the resolution
In the merge commit message (or PR comment):

```
Resolved N conflicts in <files>:

- <file>:<line> — kept cached version (PR #42 intent), retained None-check from HEAD
- <file>:<line> — independent additions, kept both
- <file>:<line> — formatting only, picked feature branch style
```

## Anti-patterns

- **"Accept both" / "Accept incoming"**: Blind acceptance ignores intent. Never do this.
- **Text-level merge**: Merging text without understanding why each side wrote it.
- **Skipping verification**: Resolved files must pass tests/type-check/lint before commit.
- **Silent resolution**: No documentation of what was resolved and why.

## When to escalate to human

- **Conflicting purposes** where neither side is clearly wrong
- **Large semantic conflicts** (>50 lines of meaningful diff per hunk)
- **Conflicts in security-sensitive paths** (auth/, payment/, security/)

## Completion criteria
- [ ] All conflicted files identified
- [ ] Each conflict's intent traced (commit message / PR context)
- [ ] Each conflict classified (independent/same-purpose/conflicting/stale/formatting)
- [ ] Resolution reflects reconciled intent (not blind acceptance)
- [ ] Tests / lint / type-check pass on resolved files
- [ ] Resolution documented in commit message or PR comment

## Related skills（边界声明）

- **github**: PR 数据通道（`gh pr view`）。本 skill 是**冲突解决逻辑**（按意图决策），github 拉 PR 元数据。组合：`gh pr view --json mergeable` 判断有冲突 → 本 skill 解决。
- **code-review**: PR 审查。本 skill 在 PR **有冲突**时介入（merge/rebase 之前），code-review 在 PR **可合并**后介入（merge 之前最后审查）。两者不重叠但**顺序相邻**。
- **diagnosing-bugs**: 解决冲突后**测试失败**时，转入 diagnosing-bugs 排查根因。
